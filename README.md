## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network, MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN is a very good website that provides documentation for HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's been very useful when it comes to examples of codes and explanation of concepts. This time it helped me to understand a bit of CSS Grid that I needed to create the layout for the buttons. It never lets me down.
- [Andy Bell's CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - This is a new one for me. I was watching Kevin Powell on YouTube and he recommended this CSS reset in one of his videos and I have been using it ever since. It does a very good job at resetting the browser default styles making it basically a blank canvas for you to work on your design. Recomend it a lot.
